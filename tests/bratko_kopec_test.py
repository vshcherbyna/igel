#   The Bratko-Kopec Test was designed by Dr. Ivan Bratko and Dr. Danny Kopec in 1982 to evaluate human or machine
#   chess ability based on the presence or absence of certain knowledge (i.e. Master, Expert, Novice, etc).
#   This test has been a standard for nearly 20 years in computer chess.
#   Experience has shown it very reliable in corresponding to the chess rating of humans and machines.
