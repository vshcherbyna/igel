GreKo.exe -s <level>

where level is an integer number from 0 to 100:

Level    Knps   Rating

GreKo 2015 ML
-------------

(new) * Added build-it command "learn" for learning from PGN file.
(chg) * Evaluation weights tuned, based on self-play.

This is yet another final release. All search and evaluation algorithms are the same as in GreKo 2015.
ML stands for "machine learning". This is the first time automated evaluation tuning is used in GreKo.

GreKo 2015 ML implements algorithm which is very similar to Texel's Tuning Method (https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Texel's+Tuning+Method).
Main difference is using fast eval() function instead of expensive qsearch() for making predictions of game results.

GreKo's evaluation is parameterized with 27 weight coefficients with the following default values:

 1. VAL_P                =  100
 2. VAL_N                =  400
 3. VAL_B                =  400
 4. VAL_R                =  600
 5. VAL_Q                = 1200
 6. PawnDoubled          =  -10
 7. PawnIsolated         =  -19
 8. PawnBackwards        =   -5
 9. PawnCenter           =    9
10. PawnPassedFreeMax    =  128
11. PawnPassedBlockedMax =  101
12. PawnPassedKingDist   =    9
13. PawnPassedSquare     =  200
14. KnightCenter         =   27
15. KnightOutpost        =    7
16. KnightMobility       =   19
17. BishopPairMidgame    =   20
18. BishopPairEndgame    =   95
19. BishopCenter         =    9
20. BishopMobility       =   72
21. Rook7th              =   24
22. RookOpen             =   17
23. RookMobility         =   40
24. QueenKingTropism     =   99
25. KingCenterMid        =  -41
26. KingCenterEnd        =   33
27. KingPawnShield       =  120

These numbers are stored in file weights.txt. If this file doesn't exist it is created with default values when program starts.

To begin learning in console mode please execute the following command:

learn <games_file> [minIndex] [maxIndex]

where:

games_file - path to PGN file, with or without .pgn extension (for example, for database.pgn you can type "learn database")
minIndex   - low bound of learning interval (optional, 1...27, default = 6)
maxIndex   - high bound of learning interval (optional, 1...27, default = 27)

If minIndex and maxIndex are not specified learning will affect only positional subset of weights, point values remain unchanged. Tuning weights of pieces usually takes longer time and does not always increase playing strength.

On the first execution of learn command for a particular PGN file the program creates FEN file with the same name (database.fen in our example). It contains FEN notation for positions to learn from (not in check, not after capture) plus some additional information (game result, ply, move played). On the next run only this file is used. If you have changed your PGN file and want to repeat learning please delete FEN file first.

During learning some information is printed to console (with copy in file learning.log): number of iteration, current values of weight, loss function on training and validation datasets. After learning new weights are in weights.txt, the original set is in weights.old file.

For files with ~10 K games learning usually takes 1-3 hours on a standard PC. The function was tested with volumes up to 100 K games. Larger files can cause an out of memory error. Intermediate values of coefficients are always in weights.txt, which can prevent data loss in case of unexpected process termination.

Learning algorithm is randomized, on each run the whole dataset from FEN file is randomly divided into training (80%) and validation (20%) subsets. This can lead to slightly different final vectors of weights after different runs.

When GreKo starts, it reads book.bin file. If there is no book.bin, it tries to read book.txt.

You can create your own book.txt, or import games from PGN and save them as book.bin. Source PGN file
should not contain comments or variations.

How to create book (example):

White(1): book clean
White(1): book import file1.pgn 40 w
maxPly = 40
white's moves only
Games: 1193, nodes: 22730
White(1): book import file2.pgn 40 b
maxPly = 40
black's moves only
Games: 1157, nodes: 44409
White(1): book import file3.pgn
maxPly = 20
Games: 1919, nodes: 52633
White(1): book save book.bin
writing book.bin...
White(1): bk
 e4 54%, d4 33%, Nf3 8%, c4 2%, g3 0%, Nc3 0%, b3 0%

Changes in move generator and in search:

(new) * Magic bitboards (can be turned off when MAGIC is not #defined in bitboards.h).

        by not actually making moves at depth = 1 :)
(new) * Simple checks generation on first levels in qsearch.
(new) * Static exchange evaluation for captures (with batteries, without pins 
        and promotions on ply > 0).
(chg) * Pruning decisions do not rely on pv/non-pv node type, again. 
(chg) * Futility pruning turned off, again.
(chg) * Use SEE score for delta pruning in qsearch instead of VALUE[captured].

        playing games, just in epdtest mode) -- thanks to Dann Corbit for bug report.

Tactical abilities seem to increase:

        WACNew   WACNew   NewIQ
        1 sec.   5 sec.   10 sec.

5.7.1   271      287      243
5.8     270      286      239  (-1...-4 solved positions - due to PGN bug)
5.8.5   290      297      276

This version could be named 5.9 since it has so many changes, but I prefer to save 
numbering space for some possible improvements.

Version 5.8
-----------
10-July-2008

The main goal of this version is source code refactoring. Core datastructures
are now more "C++ style". Position and Move data encapsulated in classes.
Got rid of pointers, some #defines etc. Small optimization for all bitscan loops.

As a result the source code is 5% more compact than 5.7.1. Perft and search run
20-30% faster (at least in the initial position).

Small changes in the move generator (castlings). Search and evaluation algorithms 
are almost unchanged except for a little fix in the hashing scheme. En-passant 
and castling rights were not taken into account in the hash code, now they are.

Time management scheme changed a little, to prevent possible losses on time 
in 3+3 games. Thanks to Volker Pittlik for mentioning the bug. Multi-PV UCI mode
modified, however it is still slow and non-optimized.

-----------

1. Bugfixes.
2. Search clean-up.

(fix)   * Fixed bug in UpdateHistory which caused assertion fails from time to time (incorrect constant).
(fix)   * Now "force" command stops pondering mode. Thanks to Volker Pittlik for bug report.

-----------

1. Bugfixes and code stability.

          Added very basic evaluation of R, N, B mobility instead. Works faster and better.

8-Jan-2006
-----------

After one-year meditations GreKo 3.x branch is again in development. 
This version goals: 1. bugfixes, 2. some changes in search 3. reviewing old code 

(fix)   * Buffer-overrun safety code in user input. Many thanks to Dann Corbit!
(fix)   * Single-reply extension (1 ply) __really__ turned on (it worked only like simple check 
          extension in 3.0).
(fix)   * Mate threat detection now works correctly (in 3.0 it was never triggered because of 
          too small search window in nullmove).

(new)   * "perft <depth> explain" command: shows perft values for all subtrees in the root.

(chg)   * Win32 binary built with MSVC 6.0 + STLPort. Works faster than MSVC's STL version.

     that gives +3...5% performance in various tests.

   * Some kind of futility pruning implemented in search.

   * "epdtest" command output modified, time and nodes calculations in test suites corrected.

   * New default settings: Learning=0, ShowEvalForWhite=0.
